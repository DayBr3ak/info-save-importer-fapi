Start by opening the script editor, google will ask you to allow to trust code execution. You can proceed, but if you don't want to, you can leave this guide now, thanks for visiting.

Now you should be able to see the default script Hiroko included in the spreadsheet, which is named Code.gs

Proceed to add 2 files named:
  - ImportSaveDialog **! make sure it's an HTML document**
